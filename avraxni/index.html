      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>
        If you don't already know what syntax is, it is the order that words go
        in, in order to make sense. There are 4 important things I need to
        cover: basic word order, adjective order, adverb order, & genitive
        (pro)noun order.
      </p>
      <h2 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h2>
      <p>
        If you would like to know what the case abbreviations mean, please refer
        to <a href="#nouncase">Noun Declension</a>. I will now explain the
        pronoun abbreviations.
      </p>
      <h3>Personal Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        1st person pronouns are pronouns like: I, me, we, & us. I / me is the
        singular 1st person pronoun, and so would be written as 1SG. We / us is
        the plural, so it'd be notated with 1PL. 2nd person pronouns include:
        you & y'all. 2SG = you, 2PL = y'all. Avraxni doesn't actually have a 2PL
        pronoun, but I just felt like I should mention it. You getting the hang
        of this? Good, now time to introduce you to animacy.
      </p>
      <p id="animacy">
        Animacy refers to whether something is "alive" or not. Animate pronouns
        then, are like: he, she, & (singular) they. I abbreviate animate as AN.
        Since these are also 3rd person pronouns, we'd write she, he, & they as
        3SGAN. You may have noticed that he, she, & they are in the same
        pronoun. This is because there are no gender distinctions in Avraxni,
        including in pronouns. Inanimate pronouns are things that aren't
        "alive". This is where the it pronoun comes in. I know many people
        identify with the pronouns it/its, so I'd like to say that I don't
        believe that those pronouns are always inanimate. I simply use "it" as
        an example of inanimate pronouns. The 3rd person plural pronoun does not
        make any animacy distinction, so it'd just be written as 3PL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to explain clusivity. With the 1st person plural pronoun, "we/us",
        there's a bit of ambiguity about who it refers to sometimes,
        specifically about whether or not you are inCLUded. If I say "we just
        bought a house", 1: you'd think I'm from a different planet with cheaper
        housing prices and want me to take you there, and 2: "we" could refer to
        "you & I" or "me & someone else". We don't use separate words for these
        concepts in English, and it's usually pretty easy to figure out what it
        means by context. However, things are diffferent in Avraxni. This
        distinction is made with "inclusive we" referring to "you & I" or "all
        of us", and "exclusive we" reffering to "us but not you". I write these
        as 1PLINCL for inclusive we & 1PLEXCL for exclusive we.

      <h2 id="declension">Noun Declension</h2>
      <p>
        Noun declension is the changing of form for nouns to show some sort of
        grammatical feature. If you've ever learned about verb conjugation, it's
        like that but with nouns. In Avraxni, you have to change the ending of a
        noun to convey case & the ending must agree in
        <a href="#animacy">animacy</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="nouncase">
        So what is case? Well, there are different functions that nouns have in
        a sentence. The roles that nouns play are always shown with prepositions
        and syntax in English. There are 5 declined cases for nouns in Avraxni.
        Nominative (NOM), genitive (GEN), associative (ASC), lative (LAT), &
        locative (LOC). That was a lot of big words all at once, so let's break
        each of these down.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the nominative case? It is the subject of a sentence. It's hard
        to describe what a subject is so I'll just show you. In bold are the
        subjects of these sentences: "<strong>I</strong> threw an apple",
        "<strong>The car</strong> drove itself away", "<strong>Her name</strong>
        was written on the plaque". The subject is usually what goes before
        English verbs. The nominative case is just assumed so u don't change the
        noun for this case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The genitive case is much easier to explain. It shows the possessor of
        another noun. It's something like "<strong>the ant's</strong> antenna" &
        "<strong>my</strong> pickle jar" but a genitive (pro)noun cannot be used
        on its own. So, in "The bag of chips aren't <strong>your's</strong>",
        there is no genitive case being used. Technically, when it's used this
        way in English, it's said to be in the possessive case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cases that are left are very easy to explain so here we go!
        Associative case basically just means "with {noun}" but it's also used
        to show possessive statements. Saying "the bread is his" would translate
        as "the bread is with him".
      </p>
      <p>
        The lative case, in Avraxni, is used in 2 ways. It basically means "to
        {noun}" and also shows the recipient of a verb. An example of this is in
        the sentence "The IRS sent you a strongly worded letter". In this
        sentence "you" is the recipient and "letter" is the object. Also in this
        sentence, "you" is probably the recipient of some fines as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The locative case means <strong>"at {noun}"</strong> and also shows the
        <strong>direct object</strong> of a sentence. I am putting all the
        <strong>direct objects</strong> in these sentences into bold letters. I
        hope you can figure <strong>it</strong> out if I keep doing
        <strong>this</strong> for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you should have a good idea of what cases are, and how they're used
        in Avraxni. The itty bitty chart below shows all the endings you must
        attach to the noun for each case and don't forget that they must agree
        with animacy.

      <h2>Verb Conjugation</h2>
      <p>
        Verb conjugation is the change in form of a verb to mark some
        grammatical function. In Avraxni, verbs conjugate for direct object,
        tense, & aspect. I'm just gonna assume that you know what direct objects
        & tenses are.
      </p>
      <h3>Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        There are three main aspects in Avraxni: Imperfective, perfective, &
        habitual. What is aspect? Well, verb tense shows at what point in time a
        verb happens: in the past, present, & future. However, sometimes you
        need more information. Verb aspect in a nutshell shows how a verb takes
        up time. To see what I mean, I'll show you some examples. Think about
        the difference between "I walk on the beach" & "I am walking on the
        beach". The difference is aspect. The first one is more ambiguous on how
        it takes up time, but the second one is pretty clear. "Walking" conveys
        that the event is ongoing or progressing continuously through time.
        Let's get into the Avraxni aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imperfective means that a verb is not an instant complete action and it
        emphasizes the process of an action rather than the completion. On the
        other hand, there's the perfective. The perfective refers to a complete
        action & emphasizes its completion. If you look at the charts, you may
        notice that perfective aspect has no present tense. This is because the
        present is ongoing. When you finish the present, it just becomes the
        past. Habitual aspect is the last one. It's pretty easy to understand
        compared to the others, don't worry. If a verb is in the habitual
        aspect, it means that the verb is done by the subject on a regular
        basis. Think about "I study Spanish". In this sentence, study would be
        in the habitual aspect because studying is something you do regularly. I
        abbreviate each of the aspects as IMP, PRF, & HAB.
      </p>

        If ur getting confused on how I abbreviate the pronouns, please check
        out the <a href="#pronouns">pronouns</a> section of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are the verb endings to apply for each aspect, tense, & object
        type.
